# Example
if 5 > 2:
    print('5 is greater than 2, magic :)')

# Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.

# The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer.
# The most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

# One individual block has to use the same number of spaces.
